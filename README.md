The Food App is a mobile application developed with React Native, enabling users to explore and discover information about food. It uses
the [The most flexible content workspace Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) to make content your competitive advantage. Additionally, I have incorporated various enhancements, including the ability to add to cart, view orders lists, and access profile information.
